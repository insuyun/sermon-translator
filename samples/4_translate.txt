As the end of the year approaches, we tend to reflect on the past year's life. Some choices might seem well-made, while others might make us want to stop and sever ties in unwanted circumstances. This could be due to certain relationships or due to given situations. When events not planned for arise in life, what kind of attitude of faith should Christians maintain? This is what we would like to explore today through the story of Paul leaving Rome.

Now, did not Paul stand trial before King Agrippa last time? And because Paul appealed to Caesar, the Roman Emperor, he now begins his voyage to Rome. The journey spans approximately 3200 kilometers, and this voyage is overseen by a centurion named Julius. Thus, Paul and several other prisoners board the ship together, accompanied by Luke, who records the Acts of the Apostles, and Aristarchus, do you remember? In Thessalonica and Ephesus, people caused an uproar and took the Christian Aristarchus and Gaius to the theater. For about two hours, they created a commotion, shouting "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians" to exalt their god Artemis, and Aristarchus was the one dragged before the authorities instead of Paul. This Aristarchus accompanies the journey to Rome. I will ask simply: Aristarchus is remembered as an easily identifiable and straightforward figure. Here you see, after being questioned in Caesarea, they board a ship from Adramyttium and briefly stay in Sidon before starting the main voyage.

However, even in around September when starting this voyage, they navigate cautiously, but by November, they generally avoid sailing. This upright task has many variables, so by November they did not sail. Now is the time when it is transitioning from October to November. So, they are heading to Rome at a precarious time when something could happen. They attempt to sail across, but the winds are rough. To block the wind, they take a path shielded by an island and sail into the sea towards Myra. If possible, they navigate along the coast over the regions of Cilicia and Pamphylia to reach a place called Nora in the region of Miletus. Here, they transfer to an Alexandria ship, which is likely a larger vessel, and head towards Myra. From Myra, they set sail once again. While passing between islands, they encounter a projection known as Nidus. After reaching Nidus, the wind becomes too strong to proceed. They need to go further, but the small islands visible here are where the Apostle John would later be exiled. Passing by Nidus, they cannot proceed further and are forced to turn back and sail southwards.

As we sailed down to the island, we passed between the south and north sides of the island of Crete and arrived at a place called Fair Havens. When we reached Fair Havens, it was with great difficulty. Paul assessed that continuing further was too perilous. It was Paul’s intention to go to Rome, and it was also God’s will; however, departing now seemed extremely dangerous. So he advised, "Let’s not proceed." But, as expressed in the Scripture, people found it uncomfortable to stay long at this place called Fair Havens. They decided to head for the harbor called Phoenix, which was further west and apparently considered a better place to stay. So they all agreed to go there. Ignoring Paul’s advice, they set sail from Fair Havens, and with the south wind blowing gently, it seemed to be a good start when we first set sail. They likely felt assured that their plan was correct and that they could spend time in Phoenix. However, before long, a great storm called the “Northeaster” began to rise in the midst of the island of Crete. Once the storm hit, the ship became unmanageable and reached a stage where it could not be controlled, thus beginning to drift aimlessly.

Paul clearly said, "Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also." But the centurion and the captain followed the advice of the pilot and the owner of the ship. They said we could go, so we set sail. But what happened? We faced great difficulty due to the storm. At first, it seemed that everything was favorable with the south wind blowing, but the situation began to deteriorate uncontrollably.

So, when you read through the 27th chapter, you will often come across people who appear frequently in life-or-death crises. They are the sailors. It is said that the sailors throw cargo into the sea. As the ship continues to sway beyond their control, it becomes a critical situation if it were to hit a sandbank or a reef. To lighten the ship and make it float a little more, the sailors throw various goods into the sea. At that time, since there were no compasses, they had to navigate by looking at the stars in the sky. However, according to the Bible, they could not see the stars because the sky was filled with clouds, obscuring the stars. As a result, they reached a situation where they could not discern north, south, east, or west. Regarding this, the Bible states, "we finally gave up all hope of being saved." In a situation where they might hit a reef at any moment, the ship, having discarded all its possessions and helplessly adrift, wandered here and there without even knowing its direction. Doesn’t thinking about a ship remind you of life? Or does it remind you of a community? Something that this community and my life must follow in a certain direction, but in an unexpected situation, all possessions disappear, and in the situation where we do not even know where we are drifting, lost and swept here and there, even the desire for salvation is gone. And when you see verse 27, it mentions that on the fourteenth night, fourteen days had passed and, amidst wandering in that darkness, people began to suspect that they were approaching some land. This is human wisdom. It is the experience of people. Fortunately, they had not yet struck a reef. And when they measured the water to grasp the depth, the depth became discernible. They mentioned the term "sounding," and sounding means measuring to about 20 fathoms, roughly measuring 36 to 40 meters. And shortly thereafter, it was found to be 15 fathoms, a slight reduction. The depth had reduced to almost 30 to 27 meters. According to the sailors' experience, when there is something, the ground is rising. It indicates there might be a reef. They intuitively sensed the dangerous situation.

So in verse 29 of the text, it is written that they dropped anchors fearing they might run aground on the rocks, specifically dropping four anchors from the stern, which is the rear part of the ship. Typically, the bow is the strongest part of the ship since it faces everything as it moves forward, and usually, anchors are dropped from the bow. However, in this incident, the anchors were dropped from the stern because dropping them from the bow could cause the ship to capsize due to strong winds unpredictably moving the ship. Therefore, thinking that they might run aground, they dropped the anchors from the stern, which can be seen as wisdom given the situation. After doing so, they were waiting, but the situation was not favorable.

So what decision do the sailors make now? All the sails are gone. We can't make any more money. We can't survive. With our wisdom, our skills, and experience, we cannot save this ship. So they wanted to escape, and while pretending to lower the ropes at the ship's bow, they were trying to set the lifeboat into the sea to escape, whether there were rocks or land. But Paul saw this. Perhaps the manuscripts say that the captain and the ship owner decided to set sail despite the difficult weather conditions. And the soldiers wanted to depart with their own democratic approach to have a more comfortable stay. But in the end, it was difficult, and eventually, they concluded there was no hope, so they intended to abandon the ship and flee. However, Paul told the soldiers, "Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, 'Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.'" Therefore, the men could not escape and had to stay on the ship with them. The sailors wanted to flee to save their lives. Paul received a message from God. He received God's word that He would save everyone on this ship. So Paul said that if the sailors left, we would have no choice but to die without them. It wasn't that the sailors' skills could save us, as even they hadn't eaten anything for fourteen days. Now, with the ship adrift and the lifeboat being launched, who knows what might happen, and their lives could be threatened. So Paul called on everyone to stay together and swiftly spoke to the soldiers to stop them. The soldiers cut the ropes of the lifeboat, resulting in losing even the lifeboat.

What Paul is saying is that he did not abandon the ship in order to save the sailors who had wisdom and ability. Even though it is true that the situation with this ship is very difficult, he is telling us not to abandon it. If you leave this place, you will find that, just like us, you cannot do anything either, and it serves as a warning spoken in the words of a dying man. These situations are things we deal with in our lives. In our lives, when we find ourselves on the ship that represents our lives in undesirable circumstances, it becomes a situation where we ponder what to do about relationships or people that do not seem to improve despite our best efforts. When you saw something through the pastoral field, what thoughts came to mind? Does this ship called our cell group, like a bolt from the blue, fill you with frustrating worries from the beginning and make you wonder how you will spend three years with them? Or, when you set sail and the south wind blew gently, did you feel relieved thinking things went well? Do you think this is indeed the best synthesis there is?

Based on your experience with the church so far, you get an immediate sense. It's crystal clear. You just need to give your heart, albeit not knowing exactly which side. You will realize that there is an attitude we must adopt in all the situations allowed in our midst. Today, let's discuss the story of Jacob. You know Jacob, right? Starting from Genesis 25, we see Jacob obtaining the birthright from Esau, which leads him to receive even greater blessings and become threatened by his brother Esau. Following his mother Rebekah's advice, he flees to his uncle Laban's house. He hurriedly escapes to the house of his uncle mentioned earlier. There, he eventually meets Rachel—a woman whom he falls in love with at first sight. Wanting to marry Rachel, he pours all his heart into it. He then tells his uncle Laban, "I will work hard for you, so please give me Rachel." So, he works for seven years. According to the Bible, because he loved Rachel so much, those seven years seemed to pass quickly, such was Jacob's experience.

So the year 2007 quickly passed, and finally, the wedding feast was held. They celebrated, and probably drank a lot. Then in the evening, after spending the first night together, when morning came, to Jacob's surprise, the woman lying with him was not Rachel, whom he dearly loved and had worked hard for seven years to marry, but Leah, her older sister. What a betrayal for the years of youth spent in effort! Jacob confronted Laban and asked, "What is this you have done to me? Why have you deceived me?" Laban responded, using a strange logic, stating that in their community, it is not customary to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one. Laban's words were complete trickery. Faced with this situation, Jacob couldn't give up on Rachel. While many might have taken a different path, Jacob couldn't abandon his pursuit. Thus, he agreed to work another seven years. In total, Jacob worked fourteen years under Laban before he was finally with Rachel.

In various situations, Leah bore children because of God’s grace even though Jacob did not love her. Leah named her children Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah. Reuben means "God has seen my misery," reflecting how Jacob did not love her. She did not initially realize her difficult position. Leah hoped for affection because God saw her. With Simeon, she believed God loved her and hoped her husband would love her too. Levi, she hoped to receive love in the future. Judah, she ultimately praised God for being able to have these precious children in her life, meaning "to praise." Meanwhile, Jacob’s affection for Rachel did not fully materialize because of their mixed situation. Subsequently, their maids bore more children to him due to disappointment and rivalry, until the end when Rachel bore Joseph and Benjamin and then died. Looking at Jacob with his 12 sons, Leah, a woman he did not initially consider, seemed like an unexpected trial. Jacob endured seven years only to marry Rachel, yet faced ongoing disputes over children. Leah and Rachel’s coexistence was not easy. Leah was never his choice; she came through deception. Jacob might have had the right to dismiss her, feeling deceived and unwilling to face constant strife. He could have left with only Rachel and returned home. However, Jacob did not choose to do so.

Despite being in an unknown situation, wondering what would happen to this household without being with me and continuing in that conflict, why did I bring the child, and then it was getting late, even though Israel, and now Meah is dying and Jacob's time for his final blessing is coming. Do you know what Jacob says at such a time? He says something astonishing. "Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite, there Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried; there Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried, and I buried Leah there." In other words, "When I die, let me lie with my children." Rachel was buried near Bethlehem. Not the cave of Machpelah. At first glance, my Rachel, whom I loved so dearly and rejoiced over so much, and Leah, whom I could have thought was a stumbling block in my life, with whom things got entangled from the beginning and caused very difficult times in the process, isn't this what we see in the Bible? Yet after many years passed, now in the midst of those weathersome years of Jacob's life, as he concludes his life, he says the place I will be buried is next to Leah. Perhaps at first, Leah was the difficulty of life, an uninvited guest-like pain, an unwanted choice one might think to send away, but witnessing what God achieved through all the time spent with her, Jacob realized that Leah was truly the place of blessing God gave me. Through Leah, although through the hardships of rivalry, Jacob was blessed with twelve sons, forming the community and nation of Israel, laying the foundation for the great nation promised to Abraham. And who comes through Judah, the last son of Leah? Jesus Christ. The lineage of Jesus Christ came from Leah. Jacob realized in this time—filled with difficulties, in what seemed like a mistake, a deception, a situation he wanted to leave—that God was overseeing it all, and what incredible blessings God sent through Leah. And for that reason, he chose Leah's side as his final resting place.

Paul was clearly of the opinion that it was best for the ship not to leave. However, these people did not realize it, or perhaps relied on their skills, and sent the ship off, leading to this situation. The one who endured the hardship for fourteen days without eating was Paul. Although I said it from the beginning, if you look at the attitude Paul had while inside that ship, he believed in the word rather than the others. He believed God that it would turn out exactly as God had spoken to Paul, not as the others. God appeared to Paul and told him that eventually, he would arrive in Rome with all the people. No matter how you look at it now, it seems over, with no stars in sight. Everything is gone now, and it was really frustrating because even the sailors, who had all that zeal, wisdom, and experience, were ready to abandon the ship. But I sought God by following His word, not looking at the situation, people's appearances, or the public opinion. I was convinced it would surely come to pass because God spoke it. What Paul showed in seeing the future in this difficulty is not saying the world's experts' experience and knowledge are unnecessary. The experience of sailors is important, but faith in holding onto God's word is crucial. This is not just the power of positivity. We believe in a faithful God who speaks to us and accomplishes His purpose clearly in these difficult situations without abandoning us. Faith is maintaining an attitude that does not give up on God's guidance, even when faced with more difficult circumstances. Paul was confident in God that way, and in all hardships, they listened to the word first.

What is the second attitude of Paul? He expresses gratitude instead of complaint. He once thought he knew the person and got married, yet clung to things that didn't match at all. I met you and faced hardships. While saying, "Why did you deceive me when you did this at that time," and refusing to lift a finger, you blame me like this. We can have many complaints, like "Why on earth did you give me Leah?" and because of that, though I am old and married, I am not happy at all. There could have been many who said, "My family is in complete chaos because of it." I tell you, let's just stay here in Miang, but wanting comfort, you suggest going to Beris, seeking solace. Paul, in a situation enduring hardship with those who went in the complete opposite direction of his will, is not honest about the failures and misalignments they are experiencing in their lives. He doesn't strive forward. He doesn't complain. He doesn't criticize. So, the assurance given by God about what His will is, he doesn't speak of at all, but observes people's departures. We are clearly thinking of God's word. There are 273 names. So, he saw them and then Paul says, God will save us. Now, let's eat something. If we fly away without eating, who knows what might happen? We don't have the strength. So he gathers them to eat, and when eating, Paul says this: He begins to give thanks to God before everyone who loves you.

In the midst of that difficult situation, not hiding in places unseen by others, but rather revealing my Lord and giving thanks to God. Is it possible to give thanks for the courage that God provides? Thankfulness is present even now in this situation. But you, too, could have lived quietly. Also, I am not afraid to boldly convey what kind of God my Lord is and what kind of heart I am captured by before Him, living a life together. He thus began giving thanks to God. I believe this is the stance that saints should adopt alongside our community or individuals in difficulties. In that difficulty, just as Jesus shared His body and blood through the Last Supper, may we stay with saints in difficulty, Christians in hardship, or our neighbors by sharing and eating like Paul giving thanks and breaking bread in Jesus' way. However, aren't you expecting to share the Lord's words and receive something new during your stay? How could you be so thankful? How could you be so thankful? Strengthen them, O Lord. Isn't it because of these protesters and complainers that this happened? Isn't it because of that person? Is it not because of this person that things aren't working out? Yet God says He will give those people to you. Didn't He mention claims and charisma, also mentioning thanksgiving earlier? Charisma, the word charisma means gift, which is God's way of saying the people given to you are gifts from Him. Because we know this is a gift, even though hardships arise, it is possible to trust God's word and give thanks because He is with us.

I once shared this before; I recall serving as a ministry leader at our church, but I never took on the role of working at the care center. Many people were looking after our youth at the center, and I was newly married when I began working there. However, thinking about my experience, I doubted my ability to properly care for the children. Spending a lot of time with kids was unfamiliar to me, and since I also desired to have my own children soon, I worried about how I would raise them once they were born. So, despite initially deciding to work at the care center, I concluded that with my wisdom and experience, I might not be able to manage it and decided to focus more on my ministry work in Hawaii. Afterward, I drove to the school. There, I conversed extensively with the pastor, sharing my thoughts while mentioning a name. Observing the place, the children were running around, opening the fridge, and moving about, which made it seem chaotic. I felt like I couldn't handle child-rearing in such an environment. Listening to stories about the children from the pastor, I observed the kids and oddly found them endearing. I inquired with the pastor about how I could serve each child individually. After the meeting, I drove back home, deeply reflecting on this experience.

What am I doing right now? I should be pulling myself together. Did I do something or what? I talked about stopping this in nursing, and was asked how to do it well, and suddenly my emotions were overwhelming. Then the representative asked, and all of a sudden, it felt like God was hitting me on the back of my head and I heard a voice saying, "Why do you refuse the gift I am giving you?" A straightforward manual as a gift for you, or what he calls a gift. I have a memory of this. Is this called a gift? I'm going to use it in the assembly because I'm in the Batemang soon, and my wife is better than me. When I was in ministry, I often had these thoughts. My peers and friends are doing fine, watching them work as associate pastors in churches and conducting impressive ministries, yet here I am handling these trivial tasks. Especially when cleaning up trash, no matter how I tell people not to just throw away their drinks, they do, leaving everything wet and smelly. And every time that happened, I kept questioning what I was doing there. Of course, from time to time, I would think, but during ministry, I worked hard, spending time, ultimately leading to a purification era of God and how it allowed me to move forward. I realized then, looking back, that those moments spent with them were a gift to cherish under God's word. If I hadn't participated in those ministries with those children, I might not have become the pastor I am in Seoul. My philosophy and vision in ministry would have been different. It was tough, indeed. But during that time, someone prayed for me and said, during your young ministry as an assistant pastor, to keep living faithfully. If you could remind me of that humble service in Potiphar's house, like Joseph enduring trials, I didn't tell him he was my star; I just asked him to pray for me. Knowing Joseph’s story brings relief because I’ve been through struggles. It’s a time to cling to God's word and understand his guidance; indeed, God's time to touch my life.

Today my wife is telling such a story. I want to try again. I feel sorry for not being more handsome and for not loving our children better. It was truly a gift from God at that time. If I had left thinking that no matter what, that ship wasn't right and it was broken, I might not have experienced that gift. If Jacob had sent Leah away like that, he might not have realized Leah's place of blessing, and if the crew had left their ship and taken the master's holy ship as if to save themselves, who knows what might have happened. But the voice of Paul telling them to stay on the ship was indeed God's word, and it was God's true water granted in the library of Jacob, who stayed with Leah. It was a gift from God. God's gift, the precious people given to us, the situations allowed to me, these relationships, our spouse, my children, our parents—God has given them to me. As we go forward in the word of the Lord in this situation and live with a heart of gratitude to God rather than complaining, acknowledging and obeying those gifts, we discover true gifts.

So this is how the remaining people were taken out with faith like pulling out a snake, and eventually everyone was saved. It's said that everyone was saved. But were they really all saved? Even to verify that, I had already counted from verse 37, the number of people with us on the ship was 270. And then they were saved. Every single one of them was saved without exception. God did not lose a single person on that ship, and God knew everything, and just as He knows the number of hairs on our heads, God fulfilled His word concerning the faithful God who knows all our circumstances. Although we lost everything and ended up on an island, Paul and I would have gained God. God reiterates these miraculous events. They were God's wonderful gifts that He accomplished, and we become those who are more enriched and clear about God.

What about the unforeseen relationships and situations in your life? You may want to leave, be proud, or worry, and time passes with human thoughts regardless of God's word. That's how it was with Paul. Pay attention to God's word, not any human words. And follow that word. Even in what seems like an unbearable difficulty for you, remember that by trusting in the Lord's word, it can become a blessing to you. And like the heart of Jacob, who finally asked to be laid to rest next to Leah, pray with the confession, "God, this person, this relationship, this situation seemed like a sinking ship to me, but it was actually a gift you gave me," and may you become a believer who approaches God. Then we will realize that the accident of this ship was already in God's plan, and through that God, may you make these gifts the Lord allows and live boldly through this time as the Lord's person. I earnestly bless you in the name of the Lord. Let us hold on to the given word and pray. Are there discouraging times in your life and in different environments and situations? There are times when you have worked hard to your best, but now think it's the end. I will listen to the Lord's word. I will trust in God's word. Because of this, I earnestly hope that it will be a year in which I experience what the gift God has allowed me is, and what blessing He hid for Leah. With such a heart, let us pray together at this time.

Among the words said by the leader of the father, God the Father, also in all these situations of God's works and my father's, protect and watch over us, God the Father. God the Father, restore us. God the Father, help us. God the Father, give and provide for us. Lord Father, God the Father, grant us. God, even in the suffering we cannot comprehend, give us the feeling not to be afraid, asking for this suffering to be taken away.
